Like the Norse god who watches over Bifr√∂st, Heimdall keeps a vigilant eye on your servers. This Python-based monitoring tool allows you to monitor multiple servers for CPU, memory, disk usage, and service status with email alerts when thresholds are exceeded.

## Features

- **Multi-Server Monitoring**: Monitor an unlimited number of servers from a single installation
- **Resource Monitoring**: Track CPU, memory, and disk usage across all your servers
- **Service Monitoring**: Monitor the status of specific services on each server
- **Email Alerts**: Receive notifications when resources exceed defined thresholds
- **Alert Management**: Smart alert tracking with cooldown periods to prevent alert storms
- **Secure Connections**: Connect to servers using SSH key authentication or password
- **Interactive Mode**: Easily add, remove, and manage servers through an interactive CLI
- **Flexible Authentication**: Support for both SSH key and password authentication

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- SSH access to the servers you want to monitor
- SMTP server for email alerts (optional)

### Installation Steps

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bnesim/heimdall-monitoring.git
cd heimdall-monitoring
```

2. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install paramiko
```

3. Make the main script executable:

```bash
chmod +x heimdall.py
```

## Configuration

Heimdall uses two configuration files:

- `config.json`: Contains general settings like email configuration and thresholds
- `servers.json`: Contains the list of servers to monitor

Both files will be created automatically with default values when you first run Heimdall.

### Email Configuration

To configure email alerts:

```bash
./heimdall.py --configure-smtp
```

Follow the interactive prompts to set up your SMTP server details.

### Adding Servers

To add servers to monitor:

```bash
./heimdall.py --interactive
```

Select option 1 to add a new server and follow the prompts. You can choose between SSH key authentication (recommended) or password authentication.

## Usage

### Interactive Mode

Run Heimdall in interactive mode to manage servers:

```bash
./heimdall.py --interactive
```

This will present a menu with options to:

1. Add a new server
2. Remove a server
3. List configured servers
4. Check all servers
5. Configure email settings
6. Exit

### Check Mode

To check all configured servers without the interactive menu:

```bash
./heimdall.py --check
```

This is useful for running Heimdall from cron jobs or other schedulers.

### Automated Monitoring

To set up automated monitoring, add a cron job:

```bash
# Edit crontab
crontab -e

# Add a line to run Heimdall every 15 minutes
*/15 * * * * /path/to/heimdall-monitoring/heimdall.py --check
```

## Alert Thresholds

Default thresholds are:

- CPU: 80%
- Memory: 80%
- Disk: 85%

Other configurable settings:

- Alert Cooldown: 1 hour (minimum time between repeated alerts for the same issue)

You can modify these in the `config.json` file.

## Logs

Heimdall maintains logs in the `logs` directory:

- `heimdall.log`: General application logs
- `alerts.log`: Record of all alerts
